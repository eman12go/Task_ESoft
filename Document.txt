-Task time: 2hr per 3 days => 6 hours

- first I creat db for category, type of category , Client ,Invoice, invoce details
with relationship using code first.

-first day I create models and migration it in db

-second&third day I create  controller,viewModel and views.

-when I add invoice I add in two table and save changes.

-sorry for this design :)
but main function completed..
like on change select in add option I bind this selected in another option. 


notes:
clients and category are static in database Idon`t do any controller for them 
we can select from database any option when we do new invoice.
so you can use bakup file :)

thanks
